# Fundamentals of AI - KU Leuven

This repository contains the coursework for the "Fundamentals of AI" course at KU Leuven, taught by Professor Tias Guns.

## Introduction

This project is part of the "Fundamentals of AI" course at KU Leuven. The course covers the basic principles and techniques of artificial intelligence, including machine learning, reasoning, and problem-solving.


## Modules
The course is divided into several modules, each focusing on a different aspect of AI:

- **Zero**: This module provides a Python tutorial for beginners, covering the basics of programming in Python.

- **Search**: In this project, my Pacman agent finds paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. This module covers the implementation of search algorithms such as BFS, DFS, UFS, A*, and heuristic functions for food search in the maze.

- **Multiagent**: This module explores the concepts and techniques related to multi-agent by requiring the design of agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. Along the way, I implemented both minimax and expectimax search and tried my hand at evaluation function design.

- **MDPs**: This module focuses on Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with a focus on the value iteration procedure.

## Course Objectives
- Understand the fundamental concepts of AI.
- Learn various AI techniques and algorithms.
- Apply AI methods to solve real-world problems.
- Develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills in the context of AI.

## Evaluation

I recieved a score of 19/20 for the entire project
